## Features

- **Circuit Design:** Easily create logic circuits by adding gates, inputs, and outputs on a virtual canvas using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Real-time Simulation:** Observe the circuit's behavior instantly as you change the input states, enabling interactive experimentation.
- **Support for Multiple Gate Types:** Logix supports a wide range of logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and more, allowing for the creation of complex circuits.
- **Zoom and Pan:** Zoom in and out, as well as pan across the canvas, to inspect circuit details or get an overview of the entire circuit.
- **Educational Tool:** Logix serves as an educational resource for learning digital logic design principles and experimenting with circuitry concepts.
